	description = Founded in 1905, the FAI is the governing body for air sports and for aeronautics and astronautics world records. If you're setting a milestone, odds are the FAI is the group certifying it. Funding, however, will come from your government--the FAI doesn't offer prizes, just record records.

	name = Bureau of Space Defense and National Security

	description = The BSDNS is the government bureau responsible for all military and intelligence-related contracts. Spy sats, GPS sats, early warning sats, secure comm sats, these guys have it all and they pay well. That said, their requirements are strict and sometimes onerous; expect requirements for certain parts to "assure access to space" or to launch things that you don't even know what they are.
